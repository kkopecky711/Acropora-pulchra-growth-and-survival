Project description:

  Data for this project were collected from a field experiment conducted in Mo'orea, French Polynesia from July-August, 2018. We tested the effect of exposure to coral predators and coral colony density on the growth and survival of Acropora pulchra (Pacific staghirn coral). We used a two-factor, fully crossed experimental design in which small coral nubbins were deployed to one of three density treatments (low: one nubbin, medium: 4 nubbins, and high: 8nubbins) and one of two coral predator exposure treatments (absent or present). We measured growth and survival of these corals after one month.
